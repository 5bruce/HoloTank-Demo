# HoloTank-Demo
Simple holographic viewer demo to show a 3D model in a mixed reality setting using [Microsoft HoloLens](http://hololens.com).

The demo shows a holographic tank, which was imported from the [Tanks! Tutorial](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/46209) from Unity Essentials, introduced at Unity Training Day 2015.

## Features
* Simple model viewer app that displays a tank floating 2 meters in front of the user at launch
* Gaze around the space to move the tank and tap to lock the tank in place
* Say "Rotate model" out loud to make the tank spin in place, or "Stop rotation" to stop it
* Tank idling sound now uses spatial sound on HoloLens
